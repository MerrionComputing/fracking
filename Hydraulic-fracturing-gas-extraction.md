# Hydraulic fracturing gas extraction (“fracking”)

The oil and gas are trapped in between the many layers of a type of rock called shale.Water is pumped down under very high pressure to crack this rock layer.

The oil and gas escape and can be pumped back out in the liquid that was pumped down.

The oil and gas are then separated from the fracking liquid.
